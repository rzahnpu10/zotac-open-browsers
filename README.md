# zotac-open-browsers
Simple powershell script to open 10 unique browsers to zotacs us store website.  
NOTE:  This has not been fully tested during a drop.  I have tried several other methods that didnt work.  this is just the next one on the list.  Ill update this readme after furthur testing.

# Description
This script will simply open 10 unique browsers windows to the zotacstore.com address.

## Why
This gives you more chances to get a lower number in the zotac queue system

## Execution
Simply run the script in powershell.  
Only supports Google Chrome currently.  
NOTE: I highly recommend that you run this script 30-40 minutes before the drop.  The google profile copy takes resources and time.  This will give you ample time to verify that profiles were setup properly.  AFter this you can close all the browsers.  Now right at drop time ~10PM EST, run this script and quickly solve the captchas to clain your sports in line

## Future
Will be adding options menu for:  
Profile copying  
Number of browser windows  
Close all browser windows  
Delete profiles
